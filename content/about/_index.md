My name is Roman Gershman, I work in [Ubimo](ubimo.com) as software engineer and chief architect. I've developed at Ubimo few key systems that are used intensively in Ubimo products. Some of those systems include Geo Server, heavily parallelized mapreduce framework, internal RPC framework,
extensible file formats that are used by engineering department and more. My passion is developing efficient algorithms and backend systems. Before Ubimo I've been working at Google for 7 years.

I've been coding for the last 25 years. Lately I feel that learning new stuff comes at the expense
of forgetting the old things. Hopefully this blog will help me to overcome these problems :)
