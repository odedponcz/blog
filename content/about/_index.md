My name is Roman Gershman, I work in [Ubimo](ubimo.com) as programmer and chief architect. I've developed there few key systems that are used intensively in Ubimo products. Some of those systems include Geo Server, heavily parallelized mapreduce framework, internal RPC framework,
extensible file formats used by engineering and more. My passion is developing efficient algorithms and backend systems.

I've been coding during last 25 years. Lately I feel that learning new stuff comes at the expense
of forgetting the old things. Hopefully this blog will help me to overcome these problems :)
